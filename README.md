# Bihar-AC-Election-Report-Cards

Objective
-There are huge water quality issues in North Bihar.  The goal is to asses how accessible clean water and sanitation is to people in North Bihar.

WHat the report cards should have
- snapshot of where do people get water and what that water quality is
- what teh status of sanitation is for that AC
- What the flood prone areas are for that AC
- how much money is spent on water and sanitation schemes in that AC

These will be designed and printed by them so we just need to provide them with:
1) cleaned up data
2) analysis
3) methodology
4) visualizations as static images that can be printed on posters and pamphlets

Maps
